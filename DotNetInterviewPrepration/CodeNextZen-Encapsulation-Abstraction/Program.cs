     *               a power button, It is not required to understand how infra-red waves are getting generated in TV remote control.
     * Encapsulation : Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method) together into a single unit i.e. class. 
     *                Encapsulation automatically achieve the concept of data hiding providing security to data by making the variable
     *                as private and expose the property to access the private data which would be public.
